# Freedom Quote Web App

This simple web app displays a quote by Jean-Jacques Rousseau on a beautiful background image. The app demonstrates basic web development concepts, including HTML, CSS, and responsive design. The focus of the project was to create a visually appealing layout that works across devices, from desktop to mobile.

## Features

- Displays a quote with the authorâ€™s name.
- Beautiful background image that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Responsive design for mobile and tablet devices.
- Basic typography styling to make the text readable and attractive.

## What I Practiced

In this project, I practiced:
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the layout adjusts correctly to different screen sizes using media queries.
- **CSS Flexbox**: To center the content both vertically and horizontally.
- **Typography**: Using custom fonts with Google Fonts and adjusting font sizes for better readability on different devices.
- **Background Styling**: Making sure the background image looks good on all devices while keeping the text readable.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the app.

## Future Improvements

- Add more quotes and change the background images dynamically.
- Include animations or transitions for the quote or background.
- Make the app interactive by allowing users to change the quote or background.
